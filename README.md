## Tromba Moderna: A Digitally Augmented Medieval Instrument

*This repository contains most of the related PD patches, and some matlab code for analysis*

An interactive museum exhibit of a digitally augmented medieval
musical instrument, the tromba marina, is presented. The tromba
marina is a curious single stringed instrument with a rattling
bridge, from which a trumpet-like timbre is produced. The physical
instrument was constructed as a replica of one found in
Musikmuseet, a musical instrument museum in Copenhagen,
Denmark. The replica instrument was augmented with a pickup,
speakers and digital signal processing to create a more reliable,
approachable and appropriate instrument for interactive display in
the museum. We report on the development and evaluation
